	-Maximum number of threads per block: 1024
	-Total number of registers available per block: 32768
	-Total amount of global memory: 7846 MBytes (8227401728 bytes)

	As N increases, the CPU becomes less efficient and the GPU keeps a fairly constant speed. The reason for the final result being 0 is an error on my part with returning memory from the device. I did not have enough time to fix it.
