Lab 9:

	I could not figure out how to set the MPI number of processes after the program has started so before starting he program we need to decide what n size and block size will be. n/block = process number. 

	N = 16 
	Block = 4
	Ran for 14ms

	N = 8 
	Block = 2
	Ran for 8ms

	N = 160 
	Block = 40
	Ran for 48ms

	N = 140
	Block = 80
	Ran for 63ms
